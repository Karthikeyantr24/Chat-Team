                Mixins are defined using the @mixin at-rule, which is written @mixin <name> { ... } or @mixin name(<arguments...>) { ... }.
                A mixin’s name can be any Sass identifier that doesn’t begin with --, and it can contain any statement other than top-level
                statements. They can be used to encapsulate styles that can be dropped into a single style rule; they can contain style rules
                of their own that can be nested in other rules or included at the top level of the stylesheet; or they can just serve to modify variables.
                Mixins are included into the current context using the @include at-rule, which is written @include <name> or 
                @include <name>(<arguments...>), with the name of the mixin being included.

                    Mixins are a language concept that allows a programmer to inject some code into a class. 
                    Mixin programming is a style of software development, in which units of functionality are created 
                    in a class and then mixed in with other classes.
